To run the notebooks, videos inside a folder called WS2020_DeepLearning_Videos are necessary. Inside this folder, the scripts expect 2 folders, one `Task1_Training_Validation` for training videos and one `Task1_Test` for test videos. In addition to that, the labels have to lie inside a csv `Task1_Test_Labels_Videos.csv` and `Task1_Training_Labels_Videos.csv` in the project root.
